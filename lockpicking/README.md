# Locks, and how to Pick 'em

### Without a key, the driver pins (blue) prevent the lock from opening. Also shown are key pins (red) and plug (yellow).

### The wrong key inserted causes the driver pins as well as some of the key pins to prevent the plug from turning.

### The correct key perfectly aligns the top of the key pins (red) with the edge of the plug (sheer point).

### The lock turns as they key pins are aligned with the edge of the plug.

# Picking Locks

### Most lockpicking techniques rely on a tension wrench to provide pressure.

### No lock is perfect. The various pins have very slight diameter or placement anomalies.

### Thus, when you apply the tension, only one of the pin stacks (key and driver pin) will be blocking the rotation. This pin is known as the “bound pin”.

# Lockpicking Techniques
## Single-pin picking
### Single-pin picking is the most traditional lockpicking technique. The key (pun!) to single pin picking is using the pick to feel for the bound pin.

### As the driver of a bound pin clears the shear line, there will be an audible click. The pin is now considered to be “set” (goes from blue to grey in the above gif). 
### An easy way to tell if a pin is set is feeling the pressure - set pins don’t have pressure from the springs above them.

# Raking
### Raking is a quicker, less precise technique. By moving all of the pins rapidly, the hope is they will catch on the shear line. Can be more damaging to a lock, but may open cheaper locks easily.

# Appendix
## Security Pins
### More complex locks have additional challenges, such as security pins. These can be tricky to identify and trickier to bypass. We have a couple of these to try.

### Visible above, the shapes of these driver pins cause them to catch before the driver pin is clear of the plug. Below, the diagrams show how different security pins can cause difficulties by “catching” before they clear the shear line.

## Master keys
### Implementing master keys is interesting - each lock must open for two different keys, one of which is the same for all locks. The diagram below shows an example of a lock supporting a master key.
