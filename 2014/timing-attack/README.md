# Temporal Attack

This is a workshop built around the W3Chall, [Temporal Attack](https://w3challs.com/challenges/challenge47). The actual challenge itself can accessed without a login [here](http://temporal.hacking.w3challs.com/administration.php).

mike_pizza has written a [skeleton python script](skelattack.py) for a potential solution in python. The rest of the script will have to be filled out by yourself as part of the challenge. He's also written a [constant time password checker](constant.py) that could defend against this type of attack.
